# Puppet modules for managing Foreman

Installs Foreman as a standalone application or using apache passenger.

Installs Foreman Proxy

May install an example puppet master setup using passenger as well, including the tweaks required for foreman.


# Installation

## Using GIT

git clone --recursive git://github.com/theforeman/foreman-installer.git -b develop

## Direct download

Since we are no longer using one repository for all sources, a single tarball is no longer provided.
Download the source code for each module on its own:

  * http://github.com/theforeman/puppet-apache/tarball/master
  * http://github.com/theforeman/puppet-foreman/tarball/master
  * http://github.com/theforeman/puppet-foreman_proxy/tarball/master
  * http://github.com/theforeman/puppet-passenger/tarball/master
  * http://github.com/theforeman/puppet-puppet/tarball/master
  * http://github.com/theforeman/puppet-tftp/tarball/master
  * http://github.com/theforeman/puppet-xinetd/tarball/master

or you can use this script:

    export MODULE_PATH="/etc/puppet/modules/common"
    mkdir -p $MODULE_PATH
    for mod in apache foreman foreman_proxy passenger puppet tftp xinetd; do
      mkdir -p $MODULE_PATH/$mod
      wget http://github.com/theforeman/puppet-$mod/tarball/master -O - | tar xzvf - -C $MODULE_PATH/$mod --strip-components=1
    done;
    echo include foreman_installer | puppet apply --modulepath $MODULE_PATH

# Requirements

if you are using RHEL, EPEL repo must be enabled <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>

if you are using Debian (or Ubuntu), see the additional notes in README.debian

# Setup

Please review the "answers" or setup file: foreman_installer/answers.yaml. This file allows
you to override any of the default parameters (as specified in <module>/manifests/params.pp

Once you have created your answer file, install it with this command:

    echo include foreman_installer | puppet apply --modulepath /path_to/extracted_tarball

The answer file is a yaml format. For a module just using the defaults, simply put
"modulename: true" to include, or false to exclude. For a module which you wish to
override any defaults, it becomes a hash, with each overridden parameter as a key-value
pair.

A few sample files now follow:

All-in-one installation:

    ---
    foreman: true
    puppet: true
    puppetmaster: true
    foreman_proxy: true

Just Foreman on it's own:

    ---
    foreman: true
    puppet: false
    puppetmaster: false
    foreman_proxy: false

Foreman and Foreman-Proxy:

    ---
    foreman: true
    puppet: false
    puppetmaster: false
    foreman_proxy: true

Puppetmaster with Git and Proxy:

    ---
    foreman: false
    puppet: true
    puppetmaster:
      git_repo: true
    foreman_proxy: true

Foreman & proxy with a different username:

    ---
    foreman:
      user: 'myforeman'
    puppet: false
    puppetmaster: false
    foreman_proxy:
      user: 'myproxy'

Extras
------

If you just want to include the relavant bits to run on your puppet master you may

    include foreman::params, foreman::config::enc, foreman::config::reports
