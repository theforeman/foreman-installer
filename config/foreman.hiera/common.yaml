  READ: This file was written the foreman-installer and not by the Foreman
  application. Any updates to subnets in the Foreman database are not
  automatically reflected in this configuration and vice versa. Configuration
  updates like DNS servers or adding/removing subnets must be done both in
  Foreman application and in this configuration preferably via
  foreman-installer. Use custom-hiera.yaml for multiple subnets.
