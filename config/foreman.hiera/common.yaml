  READ: This file was written the foreman-installer and not by the Foreman

  application. Any updates to subnets in the Foreman database are not

  automatically reflected in this configuration and vice versa. Configuration

  updates like DNS servers or adding/removing subnets must be done both in

  Foreman application and in this configuration preferably via

  foreman-installer. Use custom-hiera.yaml for multiple subnets.
