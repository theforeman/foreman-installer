# This YAML file lets you set your own custom configuration in Hiera for the
# installer puppet modules that might not be exposed to users directly through
# installer arguments.
#
# For example, to set 'TraceEnable Off' in Apache, a common requirement for
# security auditors, add this to this file:
#
#   apache::trace_enable: Off
#
# Consult the full module documentation on http://forge.puppetlabs.com,
# or the actual puppet classes themselves, to discover options to configure.
#
# Do note, setting some values may have unintended consequences that affect the
# performance or functionality of the application. Consider the impact of your
# changes before applying them, and test them in a non-production environment
# first.
